            The automated verification could not reproduce your claimed results within tolerance.

            **Possible causes:**
            - Different OpenRouter API version or endpoint
            - Rate limiting affected results
            - Environment differences

            **To fix:**
            1. Ensure you're using the latest \`modelforecast\` version
            2. Try running with \`--seed 42\` for reproducibility
            3. If results are legitimately different, include explanation in PR description

            See workflow logs for detailed comparison.`

              "output": "Here is a review of the previous chapter based on the provided text:\n\n## Review of Chapter 1\n\n### 3 Key Plot Points:\n\n1.  **The Setting and Atmosphere:** The chapter firmly establishes the location as **Ares VI**, a pressurized dome on Mars. The atmosphere is immediately set as isolated, sterile, and hostile (dust the color of old blood, thin air).\n2.  **The Discovery of the Crime:** Detective Kaito Ishikawa is introduced, and he confirms the central conflict: **Dr. Lena Hanson has been murdered** inside the base.\n3.  **The Method of Death/Crime Scene Detail:** A crucial piece of evidence is noted: Dr. Hanson's **visor is cracked**, suggesting a potential breach of environmental integrity or a violent assault linked to the Martian atmosphere.\n\n### 1 Potential Inconsistency:\n\n*   **The Cause of Death vs. The Airlock Status:** The text states, \"The airlock seal is compromised, Detective,\" immediately after Kaito is observing the scene. However, Dr. Hanson is found *inside* the dome near the hydroponics bay, not immediately at the airlock. The inconsistency lies in the implication: **If the airlock seal is compromised, why is the base AI still functioning and Kaito breathing freely inside?** A major airlock failure would typically lead to rapid depressurization or at least an immediate, critical system alert for the entire habitat, which isn't fully detailed yet, suggesting the \"compromise\" might be localized or not immediately fatal to the entire habitat structure.",

The cracked visor was the key. \"The airlock seal is compromised, Detective,\" said Security Chief Rona, her voice tight over Kaito's comms.\n\nKaito ignored her, his gaze fixed on the hairline fracture. A full breach would have vented the Hab instantly. This was localized, precise. \"Rona, confirm the internal environmentals. Pressure stable? Oxygen density nominal?\"\n\n\"Stable, Detective. Except for this sector. The environmental sensors near Hydroponics are spiking\u2014minor pressure drop, then stabilization. It looks like a *single-person* breach, quickly sealed, but not by the victim.\"\n\nKaito touched the edge of the cracked polycarbonate. It wasn't a blunt impact; it was a focused stress fracture. \"She didn't suffocate,\" he murmured. \"She was exposed, then pulled back in, or the killer used the environment as a weapon.\" He looked up at the sterile white ceiling of Ares VI, the dust outside the dome the color of old blood. This wasn't just murder; it was a violation of the fragile shell keeping them alive.",

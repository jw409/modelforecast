I don't have a tool to check the weather for a specific location or to access weather services.\n\nWithout access to real-time weather data, I can't provide accurate information about today's weather. I could potentially make assumptions about the user's location and provide general information, but that wouldn't be helpful or accurate.\n\nThe most appropriate response would be to inform the user that I don't have access to real-time weather data and suggest alternative ways they can check the weather themselves.

While the text doesn't show the travel time, the immediate donning of the suit suggests he is preparing for an imminent departure or confrontation. A 200 km distance on Mars, even with specialized vehicles, is a significant journey. The inconsistency lies in the *immediacy* of his reaction versus the *scale* of the required travel, which might require more logistical setup than just flipping the seal on his helmet.\n\n*(Note: This is a minor point, as the next chapter will likely detail the transport, but the immediate shift from alert to action across a vast distance is worth noting.)*",

Typically, indoor areas maintain breathable atmosphere, and helmets are donned only when exiting to the surface or entering compromised sections.

While a breach *could* be related to a struggle, the text implies the primary threat is internal (murder) rather than external (atmosphere loss). If the station was suffering a catastrophic atmosphere breach, Elias would likely be focused on sealing the breach or donning emergency gear, not immediately confirming the cause of death, which appears to be blunt force/impact trauma (shattered helmet). **The inconsistency lies in whether the external threat signaled by \"Breach\" is the actual immediate danger, or if the word was used metaphorically or incorrectly by the dying doctor.**",
